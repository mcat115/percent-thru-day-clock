Ever wonder not what time it is on a clock, but what percent through the day you are? If so, this is the app for you!

Dependency: Made with Ruby 2.7.3 

To create locally:

- Open a terminal and cd to the folder that will house this project's folder
- `git clone https://github.com/mcat115/percent-thru-day-clock`
- `bundle install`
- `yarn install`
Then in two seperate terminals:
- `ruby server.rb`
- `yarn start`

It should be running on localhost:4567!
